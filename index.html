<p><tt>Hello there,stranger. Welcome to my tiny abode in the inter-webs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you might have known,I have introduced myself as an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_engineering">Electronics and a Computer Engineer.</a></p>
<p>My tryst with Electronics began when I pored over the classic&nbsp;<em>Resnick and Halliday&nbsp;</em>textbook in Physics,and the chapter on Semiconductor Physics immediately grabbed my attention--with the words as&nbsp;<em>Digital Logic of Electronic Circuits,</em> being used to describe the underlying principle of a computer.</p>
<p>I began my programming journey learning C and C++,along with the trusty assembly language. Currently,I am interested in Data Analytics.</p>
<p>Apart from that,my interests range from Cryptography, History, Political Theory, Classical Liberalism,internet freedom and esoteric programming languages.</p>

So till next time,dear visitor.
